# Document Structure Continued

## Learning Goals

- Recognize basic HTML document structure
- Recognize HTML comments
- Describe the `head` section and its contents
- Create an HTML document

## Introduction

Every HTML document has a specific set of required tags. Because these are
required _every_ time we create a web page, it is valuable to gain a more
in-depth understanding of what these tags do, why they are useful, and how they
work in context to the modern web.

We will be both reviewing setting up well-formed HTML documents and expanding a
bit on the `DOCTYPE`, `html` and `head` tags, as well as introducing how to add
comments within our HTML code.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already, fork and clone this lesson into your local environment.
Navigate into its directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files
in Visual Studio Code (If you are using a different text editor, the command
will be different). Finally, run `npm install` to install the lab's
dependencies.

## Recognize Basic HTML Document Structure

Let's start by adding the bare essentials of an HTML document to the provided
`index.html` file:

- A `DOCTYPE` tag, which looks like this: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- Opening and closing `html` tags
- Opening and closing `head` tags nested inside the `html` tags
- Opening and closing `body` tags nested inside the `html` tags

If written correctly, running `npm test` now will pass the **first** test of
this lab. **However** you will not be done yet! We have to make **all** the
tests pass in order to make the test code happy! Fixing this first one means
that we get to attack the next one. Let's get to it!

Let's take a closer look at these tags.

### `<!DOCTYPE html>`

At the top of every HTML document, you're always going to start off with the
same element, `DOCTYPE`. In the early days of the internet, there were fewer
standards, and it was important to declare the specific way we wanted browsers
to interpret the file at the top of each file. Netscape and Internet Explorer
would look for this declaration and handle the content differently depending on
what it found. These days, every current browser is compatible with HTML5, and
`DOCTYPE` is mainly used to tell the browser to render the page in standards
compliant mode.

The `DOCTYPE` element, as with all HTML, starts with a `<` and ends with a `>`.
Uniquely, the `DOCTYPE` tag starts with an exclamation point, `!`, followed by
`DOCTYPE`, then specifies which version of HTML we want to use. In HTML5, we
just write `html` and the browser interprets the rest of the document as HTML5.

### `<html>`

The next element is also always required: `<html>`. This tells the browser that
everything that falls between the opening and closing `html` tags is to be
interpreted as HTML code.

One attribute that is important to include in the `<html>` tag is `lang`, which
declares what language the webpage is written in. In our case, writing in
English, we will use `lang="en"`. This helps search engines to know what
language a page is written in. Google, for instance, can use the `lang`
attribute to know when to prompt users about translating web content.

```html
<html lang="en"></html>
```

## Recognize HTML Comments

Sometimes we want to leave notes either for ourselves or for other developers
inside of our HTML files. An example might be a brief explanation of what some
part of the code is doing, or an important message or reminder. We can write
comments by wrapping the text we want like so:

```html
<!-- This is a comment! -->
```

Text included in a comment will not be visible on the webpage, but will be
visible in the browser console and `.html` file.

## Describe the `head` Section and its Contents

Inside our `html` tags, we divide the page into two main sections, `head`, and
`body`, which both play unique roles. The remainder of our HTML lessons will
cover everything within the `body` section, but before we get there, there are
some additional bits of information we need to understand regarding the `head`.
The `head` section is not visible to a website visitor, but it contains a lot of
useful info about our webpage.

In the `head` section, we place a number of specific tags, most notably:

- `<link>`
- `<title>`

Let's look at each of them in turn:

### `link`

The `<link>` tag is for importing files.

**CAREFUL**: It's easy to get confused here because web pages are full of links,
but also use a `<link>` tag. "Links" that you click on are located within the
`<body>` element. The `<link>` tags are located in the `<head>` element.

Most commonly, we'll use `<link>` to import CSS files. Like so:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />
```

Linking style sheets this way allows multi-page websites to share a source of
styling content for every page, making for a consistent, easy to maintain file
structure. Often, on fully developed websites, multiple style sheets are linked
in the `head`. For example, when doing the final polishing of a web site you
might see a series of `<link>` definitions like:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
/>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="company.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="engineering-department.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="project-x-launch.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="typography.css" />
```

In this example we're getting some CSS information from the
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) project, we're integrating a company
style standard, an engineering style standard, a style motif for the launch of
"Project X" and then we're adding some specific rules about font display. You
can bring in a **lot** of information with the `<link>` tag!

This specific example aside, you'll be learning a lot more about linking files
to create stylistic effect in later lessons.

### `title`

One more common tag we find in the `head` is `title`. The `title`, as its name
implies, is where the title of the webpage should be entered. Text added inside
the `title` tags will appear up on your browser tab. Adding a title for our
`index.html` page would look something like:

```html
<title>Cat Perry's Favorite Cats</title>
```

Notice that unlike the previous tags we've discussed, `title` has an opening and
closing tag. In most modern browsers, tabs are fairly small, so it is often best
to keep the title brief, or it will not be fully visible.

## Create an HTML Document

Okay, time to put what we've learned to the test. To complete this lab, you must
apply all the tags we've discussed in this lesson. Run `npm test` to see what is
required to pass each test. Each test will urge you on.

## Saving Your Work Remotely

Currently, the work you've done on this assignment is only on your local
machine. To preserve work on your GitHub fork, you will need to stage the
changes you've made, commit them, and push the commit up to GitHub. Use the
following commands to do this:

```console
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Completed assignment"
$ git push
```

If you visit your fork on GitHub, you should now see that _you've_ made the most
recent commit, and your solution will be present in the files.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've reviewed the basics of document structure, as well as what
is typically contained within the `head`. Using the `head` section, we are able
to add relevant data about our webpage as a whole. As a bonus surprise, by
learning how to make our web pages _search engine friendly_, we've also dabbled
a bit into the basics of Search Engine Optimization! We are now ready to take a
deeper dive into the visual content of HTML pages.
